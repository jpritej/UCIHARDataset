UCIHARDataset
=============
## The goal of this script is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later 
## analysis. This R script does the following:
## Step1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
## Step2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for
##        each measurement. 
## Step3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data 
##        set
## Step4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
## Step5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
##        variable for each activity and each subject.
