=============
The goal of run_analysis.R script is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The original raw data can be found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


This R script does the following:
* Step 1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Step 5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
